# natours-final
This is the file for Natours, a project that was done to learn advanced HTML, CSS, SASS and BEM (block element modifier).
This is a great reference HTML website for use when building any website, wordpress, or other if you just want to build a static HTML site.

Very basic SASS file structure was used as this if first part of learning how to use SASS on a website. 5 main SASS folders were set up with partial files within. Partial files were added as needing in the styling of the website. This helps to break up the code into smaller modules which allow for easier editing. 

I used Codekit to compile and run SASS so no other task runners or pre-processors were used.
